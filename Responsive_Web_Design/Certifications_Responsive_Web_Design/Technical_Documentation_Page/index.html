                    System administration refers to the management
                    and maintenance of computer systems, networks,
                    and servers. It involves tasks such as
                    configuring, monitoring, updating, and 
                    troubleshooting hardware and software 
                    components to ensure smooth operation and
                    optimal performance. System administrators 
                    are responsible for installing and 
                    maintaining operating systems, managing user 
                    accounts and permissions, implementing 
                    security measures, and handling backup and 
                    recovery processes. They play a crucial role
                    in ensuring the reliability, security, and
                    efficiency of IT infrastructure within an
                    organization.

                    Web development involves the creation, design,
                    and maintenance of websites and web applications.
                    It encompasses various aspects such as front-end
                    development, back-end development, and 
                    full-stack development. Front-end developers 
                    focus on designing and coding the user 
                    interface and user experience of websites 
                    using technologies like HTML, CSS, and 
                    JavaScript. Back-end developers work on 
                    server-side logic, databases, and application 
                    functionality using programming languages like 
                    Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js. Full-stack 
                    developers are proficient in both front-end 
                    and back-end development and can handle all 
                    aspects of web development. Additionally, web
